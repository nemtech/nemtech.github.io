Transaction
###########

A transaction generally represents a unit of work within a database system. In the case of blockchain, that is when an action signed by an :doc:`account <account>` changes its state.

Transactions accepted by the network are stored permanently on :doc:`blocks <block>`.

*****************
Transaction types
*****************

.. _transaction-types:

There are different types of transactions. For example, you can transfer :doc:`mosaics <mosaic>` between accounts, transfer or configure the ownership of accounts (including the use of :doc:`multisig <multisig-account>` rules), and more.

.. _transaction-definition:

**********************
Defining a transaction
**********************

Transactions are defined in a `serialized <https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer>`_ form. Each transaction extends from the :ref:`transaction schema definition <transaction>`, combining the type's particular properties. You can find the description of the additional properties under the :ref:`"Schema" section <transfer-transaction>`, at the end of each built-in feature description.

We recommend `using the NEM2-SDK to define <https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-docs/blob/master/source/resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.ts#L30>`_ transactions.

.. code-block:: typescript

    import {
        Address,
        Deadline,
        NetworkCurrencyMosaic,
        NetworkType,
        PlainMessage,
        TransferTransaction
    } from "nem2-sdk";

    const recipientAddress = Address
        .createFromRawAddress('SD5DT3-CH4BLA-BL5HIM-EKP2TA-PUKF4N-Y3L5HR-IR54');

    const transferTransaction = TransferTransaction.create(
        Deadline.create(),
        recipientAddress,
        [NetworkCurrencyMosaic.createRelative(10)],
        PlainMessage.create('Welcome To NEM'),
        NetworkType.MIJIN_TEST);

    console.log(transferTransaction.serialize());

.. _fees:

Fees
====

Transactions have an associated cost. This cost is necessary to provide an incentive for the :doc:`harvesters <harvesting>` who secure the network and run the infrastructure.

The fee associated with a transaction primarily depends on the transactionâ€™s size. The effective fee is the product of the size of the transaction, and a fee multiplier set by the harvester. The node owner can configure the latter value to all positive values, including zero.

    effective_fee = transaction::size * block::fee_multiplier

A sender of a transaction must specify during the transaction definition a ``max_fee``, meaning the maximum fee the account allows to spend for this transaction.

If the ``effective_fee`` is smaller or equal to the ``max_fee``, the harvester can opt to include the transaction in the block. The ``fee_multiplier`` is stored in the :ref:`block header <block-header>`, permitting to resolve which was the effective fee paid for every transaction included.

The harvesting nodes can decide their transaction inclusion strategy:

* **Prefer-oldest**: Preferred for networks with high transaction throughput requirements. Include first the oldest transactions.
* **Minimize-fees**: Philanthropic nodes. Include first transactions that other nodes do not want to include.
* **Maximize-fees**: Most common in public networks. Include first transactions with higher fees.

By default, the fee is paid in ``cat.currency``, the underlying currency of the NEM network. Private chains can edit the configuration of the network to eliminate fees, or use another :doc:`mosaic <mosaic>` that better suits their needs.

.. _transaction-signature:

*********************
Signing a transaction
*********************

Accounts must sign transactions before announcing them to the network. `Signing a transaction <https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-docs/blob/master/source/resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.ts#L40>`_ expresses the account's agreement to change the network state as defined.

For example, a transfer transaction describes who is the recipient and the quantity of mosaics to transfer. In this case, signing the transaction means to accept moving those mosaics from one account's balance to another.

An account has to follow the next steps to `sign a transaction <https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-library-js/blob/f171afb516a282f698081aea407339cfcd21cd63/src/transactions/VerifiableTransaction.js#L64>`_ :

1. Get the ``signing bytes``, which are all the bytes of the transaction except the size, signature and signer.
2. Get the nemesis block generation hash. You can query ``http://localhost:3000/block/1`` and copy ``meta.generationHash`` value.
3. Prepend the nemesis block generation hash to the signing bytes.
4. Sign the resulting string with the signer's private key. This will give you the transaction ``signature``.
5. Append the signer's signature and public key to the transaction to obtain the ``payload``.
6. Calculate the `hash of the transaction <https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-library-js/blob/f171afb516a282f698081aea407339cfcd21cd63/src/transactions/VerifiableTransaction.js#L76>`_ applying the network hashing algorithm to the first 32 bytes of signature, the signer public key, nemesis block generation hash, and the remaining transaction payload.

.. code-block:: typescript

    import {Account} from "nem2-sdk";

    const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string;
    const generationHash = process.env.GENERATION_HASH as string;
    const account = Account.createFromPrivateKey(privateKey,NetworkType.MIJIN_TEST);

    const signedTransaction = account.sign(transferTransaction, generationHash);

    console.log(signedTransaction.payload);

.. _transaction-validation:

************************
Announcing a transaction
************************

Signed transactions are ready to be announced to the network. You can either use the SDK ``TransactionHttp`` service or append the payload to the request of the `transaction endpoint <https://nemtech.github.io/endpoints.html#operation/announceTransaction>`_.

.. example-code::

    .. code-block:: typescript

        import {TransactionHttp} from "nem2-sdk";

        const transactionHttp = new TransactionHttp('http://localhost:3000');

        transactionHttp
            .announce(signedTransaction)
            .subscribe(x => console.log(x), err => console.error(err));

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl -X PUT -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"payload":"B3000000F77A8DCFCB57B81F9BE5B46738F7132998F55123BFF4D89DC8E5CAE1F071A040E5571F4D8DA125B243C785DA5261F878E3DE898815F6E8F12A2C0A5F0A9C3504FA6249E8334E3F83E972461125504AFFD3E7750AFBB3371E7B2D22A599A3D0E3039054410000000000000000265DEE3F1700000090FA39EC47E05600AFA74308A7EA607D145E371B5F4F1447BC0F00010057656C636F6D6520546F204E454D44B262C46CEABB858096980000000000"}' http://localhost:3000/transaction

After announcing the transaction, the REST API will always return an OK response immediately. At this point, it is still unknown whether the transaction is valid.

.. figure:: ../resources/images/diagrams/transaction-cycle.png
    :width: 800px
    :align: center

    Transaction cycle

The first stage of validation happens in the API nodes. If the transaction presents some error, the WebSocket throws a notification through the status channel. In the positive case, the transaction reaches the P2P network with an **unconfirmed** status.  Never rely on a transaction which has an unconfirmed state. It is not clear if it will get included in a block, as it should pass a second validation.

The second validation is done before the transaction is added in a harvested block. If valid, the harvester stores the transaction in a block, and it reaches the **confirmed** status.

Continuing the previous example, the transaction gets processed and the amount stated gets transferred from the signer's account to the recipient's account. Additionally, the transaction fee is deducted from the signer's account.

The transaction has **zero confirmations** at this point. When another block is added to the blockchain, the transaction has one confirmation. The next block added to the chain will give it two confirmations and so on.

*********
Rollbacks
*********

Blockchains are designed in a way that under certain circumstances recent blocks need to be rolled back. These are essential to resolve forks of the blockchain.

The :properties:`rewrite limit <config-network.properties>` is the maximum number of blocks that can be rolled back. Hence, forks can only be resolved up to a certain depth too.

NEM has a rewrite limit of ``40`` blocks. Once a transaction has more than 40 confirmations, it cannot be reversed.

.. From experience, forks that are deeper than 20 blocks do not happen, unless there is a severe problem with the blockchain due to a bug in the code or an attack.
