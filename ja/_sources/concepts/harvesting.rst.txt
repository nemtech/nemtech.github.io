Harvesting
##########

The process of creating new :doc:`blocks <block>` is called harvesting.

The harvesting :doc:`account <account>` - called the harvester - gets the :ref:`fees <fees>` for the transactions in the block and :doc:`inflation <inflation>`. This reward gives the harvester an incentive to add as many transactions to the block as possible.

********************
Eligibility criteria
********************

The :ref:`importance score <importance-calculation>` determines the probability of an account to harvest the next block in case the account has harvesting turned on and all other accounts are harvesting too.

.. note:: Configuration parameters are editable. The importance score calculation formula and the minimum amount required to harvest may differ for the public network configuration.

The account needs to hold a `minimum amount <https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server/blob/master/resources/config-network.properties#L30>`_ of this harvesting mosaic to have importance greater than zero.

Harvesting account owners can use their importance scores to create new blocks either by :ref:`running a node <local-harvesting>` or delegating it to a :ref:`remote node <delegated-harvesting>`.

.. _harvesting-mosaic:

*****************
Harvesting mosaic
*****************

Catapult software allows the `definition <https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server/blob/master/resources/config-network.properties#L13>`_ of any :doc:`mosaic <mosaic>` for harvesting purposes to fit the business needs. The catapult test network names this mosaic ``cat.harvest``.

For example, consortium networks can distribute harvesting mosaics between the companies that are running the infrastructure, while other participants need to pay fees in the form of :ref:`currency mosaic <fees>` to consume services.

By contrast, public networks might decide to use the same mosaic for paying transaction fees and running the network.

.. _local-harvesting:

****************
Local harvesting
****************

During the installation of a :doc:`node <node>`, you will be asked to set up an account that will be used to harvest. The :ref:`block header <block-header>` includes the public key and signature generated by
the harvesting account.

Besides, each node can set a ``beneficiary`` public key to share a percentage of the harvesting rewards (:ref:`fees <fees>` and :doc:`inflation <inflation>`), where the sharing ratio is configurable for each network. When the node does not define a beneficiary, all the rewards go to the block signer.

Local harvesting is secure as long as no one accesses your node instance, which is storing the private key.

.. _delegated-harvesting:

********************
Delegated harvesting
********************

Delegated harvesting enables an account to use a proxy private key that can be shared with a node securely. In other words, you can use the importance score of your account to create new blocks without running a node.

After an account activates delegated harvesting, its importance score is transferred to a remote account. The remote account inherits the importance of the original account.

Security-wise, sharing a proxy private key with a remote node does not compromise the original account since:

* The remote account has zero balance.
* The remote account by itself can't transfer the importance to another account.
* The original account receives the resulting fees.

Remote harvesters may not receive the entire reward if the following conditions are met:

*  The network harvesting sharing rate is greater than 0.
*  The node selected has defined a :ref:`beneficiary account <local-harvesting>`.

.. _account-link-transaction:

AccountLinkTransaction
======================

Announce an AccountLinkTransaction to delegate the account importance to a proxy account. By doing so, you can enable delegated harvesting.

In order for the proxy account to be accepted as the ``remoteAccountKey`` for delegated harvesting, it needs to meet the following conditions:

* It cannot own any mosaics.
* It cannot be a cosignatory of any other account.
* It cannot be a multisig account.
* It cannot already be a delegated account for another account.
* It cannot have its own delegated account.

Furthermore, for the duration that the account is used as a delegated account, it is restricted from:

* initiating any transactions.
* involvement with any type of transactions.

**Entity type**: 0x414C

**Inlines**:

* :ref:`Transaction <transaction>` or :ref:`EmbeddedTransaction <embedded-transaction>`
