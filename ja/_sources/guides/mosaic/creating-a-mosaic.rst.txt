Creating a mosaic
#################

Follow this guide to create a :doc:`mosaic<../../concepts/mosaic>`.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

- Finish the :doc:`getting started section <../../getting-started/setup-workstation>`
- Have one :ref:`account with cat.currency <setup-getting-a-test-account>`

************************
Letâ€™s get into some code
************************

Mosaics can be used to represent any asset in the blockchain such as objects, tickets, coupons, stock share representation, and even your cryptocurrency.

You will need to announce two transactions to create a mosaic:

1. A :ref:`mosaic definition transaction <mosaic-definition-transaction>` to create the mosaic, with the following properties:

.. _mosaic-properties:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Property", "Value", "Description"
    :delim: ;

    Divisibility; 0 ; The mosaic won't be divisible.
    Duration; 1000; The mosaic will be registered for 1000 blocks.
    Supply mutable; True; The mosaic supply can change at a later point.
    Transferable; True; The mosaic can be transferred between arbitrary accounts.

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :caption: |creating-a-mosaic-ts|
        :language: typescript
        :lines:  33-50

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :caption: |creating-a-mosaic-js|
        :language: javascript
        :lines: 33-50

2. A :ref:`mosaic supply change transaction <mosaic-supply-change-transaction>`, to set the supply. We are going to create 1.000.000 mosaic units.

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :caption: |creating-a-mosaic-ts|
        :language: typescript
        :lines:  52-57

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :caption: |creating-a-mosaic-js|
        :language: javascript
        :lines: 52-57

3. Both transactions can be announced together using an :ref:`aggregate transaction <aggregate-transaction>`.

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :caption: |creating-a-mosaic-ts|
        :language: typescript
        :lines:  59-

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :caption: |creating-a-mosaic-js|
        :language: javascript
        :lines: 59-

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/cli/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.sh
        :caption: |creating-a-mosaic-cli|
        :language: bash
        :start-after: #!/bin/sh
