#################
Creating a mosaic
#################

Follow this guide to create a :doc:`mosaic<../../concepts/mosaic>`.

**********
Background
**********

Mosaics can be used to represent any asset in the blockchain such as objects, tickets, coupons, stock share representation, and even your cryptocurrency.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

- Finish the :doc:`getting started section <../../getting-started/setup-workstation>`
- Have one :ref:`account with cat.currency <setup-getting-a-test-account>`

************************
Letâ€™s get into some code
************************


Define two transactions to create a mosaic:

1. A :ref:`mosaic definition transaction <mosaic-definition-transaction>` to create the mosaic, with the following properties:

.. _mosaic-properties:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Property", "Value", "Description"
    :delim: ;

    Divisibility; 0 ; The mosaic won't be divisible. Determines up to what decimal place the mosaic can be divided.
    Duration; 1000; The mosaic will be created for the next 1000 blocks. If you want to create a non-expiring mosaic, do not set this property.
    Supply mutable; True; The mosaic supply can change at a later point.
    Transferable; True; The mosaic can be transferred between arbitrary accounts. Otherwise, the mosaic can be only transferred back to the mosaic creator.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

2. A :ref:`mosaic supply change transaction <mosaic-supply-change-transaction>`, to set the supply. We are going to create 1.000.000 mosaic units.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

.. note:: NEM mainly works with absolute amounts. To get an absolute amount, multiply the amount of assets you want to create by 10\ :sup:`divisibility`.  For example, if the mosaic has divisibility 2, to create 10 units (relative) you should define 1000 (absolute) instead.

3. Both transactions can be announced together using an :ref:`aggregate transaction <aggregate-transaction>`.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 03 */
        :end-before: /* end block 03 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 03 */
        :end-before: /* end block 03 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/bash/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.sh
        :language: bash
        :start-after: #!/bin/sh
