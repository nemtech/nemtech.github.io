    Sending a transfer Transaction

Alice wants to send ``10 cat.currency`` to Bob, whose address is ``SD5DT3-CH4BLA-BL5HIM-EKP2TA-PUKF4N-Y3L5HR-IR54``.

Monitoring the network
======================

Once an account announces a transaction, the server will always return an OK response. Receiving an OK response does not mean the transaction is valid. A good practice is to monitor transactions before being announced.

To understand the transaction lifecycle, we recommend you to open three new terminals. The first terminal :doc:`monitors announced transactions<../transaction/monitoring-a-transaction-status>` validation errors.

.. code-block:: bash

    nem2-cli monitor status

Monitoring ``unconfirmed`` shows you which transactions have reached the network, but are not included in a block yet.

.. code-block:: bash

    nem2-cli monitor unconfirmed

Once a transaction is included, you will see it under the ``confirmed`` terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

    nem2-cli monitor confirmed

************************
Letâ€™s get into some code
************************

1. Create the transfer transaction, including Bob address as the recipient and ``10 cat.currency``.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

As you may have noticed, transfer transactions require an array of mosaics as a parameter, allowing to send transfer transactions with multiple mosaics at the same time.

If you own more than one mosaic, you can send them together in the same transaction:

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransactionWithMultipleMosaics.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingATransferTransactionWithMultipleMosaics.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

.. note:: NEM mainly works with absolute amounts. To get an absolute amount, multiply the amount of assets you want to send by 10\ :sup:`divisibility`.  For example, if the mosaic has :doc:`divisibility <../mosaic/getting-mosaic-information>` 2, to send 10 units (relative) you should define 1000 (absolute) instead.

2. Sign the transaction with Alice's account.

.. note:: To make the transaction only valid for your network, include the first block generation hash. Open ``http://localhost:3000/block/1`` in a new tab and copy the ``meta.generationHash`` value.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

3. Once signed, :doc:`announce the transaction <../../concepts/transaction>` to the network.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 03 */
        :end-before: /* end block 03 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 03 */
        :end-before: /* end block 03 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/bash/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.sh
        :language: bash
        :start-after: #!/bin/sh

4. Open the terminal where you are monitoring account transactions ``status``. It should be empty. If there is an error, you can check :ref:`the error code meaning here <status-errors>`.

A new transaction should have appeared in the terminal where you are monitoring ``unconfirmed``. At this point, the transaction has reached the network, but it is not clear if it will get included in a block.

If it is included in a block, the transaction gets processed, and the amount stated in the transaction gets transferred from the sender's account to the recipient's account.
