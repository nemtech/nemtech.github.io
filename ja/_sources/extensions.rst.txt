Developers could opt to create extensions to add more features into NEM. However, to become an accepted extension, it should be proposed as a |NIP|.

The reason behind the |NIP| is to ensure that the new library is reviewed, tested and shared among NEM developers.

* Accepted specification
* At least one implementation that successfully passes the code review.
* Compatible with third-party projects that implement/uses the same NIP Library.

Do you need to create a NIP to create an extension? No, you donâ€™t. In fact, we suggest not submitting a NIP until you build a extension that improves the NEM blockchain and the different projects that use it. Since the extension can be changed multiple times, developers should spend more time experimenting and learning, creating a specification later on.

Add a new extension to this page by clicking the *"Edit on Github"* button at the top-right part of the screen.
