|codename| provides access to both public and private blockchains, individually or as a hybrid, providing options to best suit your project needs.

* **Public chain**: The |codename| public chain is a platform supported by a decentralized network of nodes. Entities on the platform can freely communicate and exchange value with one another in a trustless environment. `XYM <https://symbolplatform.com/xym/>`_ serves as the native currency to |codename|'s public blockchain.

* **Private chain** Private chains, on the other hand, are permissioned blockchains that prefer privacy, compliance, customization, and efficiency over decentralization. You can choose to deploy their own private chains with |codename| in cases where blockchain technology is desired in a closed ecosystem. 

* **Hybrid chain**: By utilizing both public and private blockchains, you can preserve an intimate ecosystem in a private chain and communicate freely with the public chain as a decentralized hub of data.
