Account Filter
##############

.. note:: Account filters feature is not implemented in the SDK yet.

:doc:`Accounts<account>` may configure a set of smart rules to block announcing or receiving transactions given a series of constraints.

The editable on-chain constraints are called filters. Accounts can configure the following types:

**************
Address filter
**************

An account can decide to receive transactions only from an allowed list of :doc:`addresses <account>`. Similarly, an account can specify a list of addresses that donâ€™t want to receive transactions from.

.. note:: Allow and block filters are mutually exclusive. In other words, an account can only configure a block or an allow list per type of filter.

By default, when there is no filter set, all the accounts in the network can announce transactions to the stated account.

*************
Mosaic filter
*************

An account can configure a filter to permit incoming transactions only if all the :doc:`mosaics <mosaic>` attached are allowed. On the other hand, the account can refuse to accept transactions containing a mosaic listed as blocked.

*****************
EntityType filter
*****************

An account can allow/block announcing outgoing transactions with a :ref:`determined type <transaction-types>`. By doing so, it increases its security, preventing the announcement by mistake of undesired transactions.

Examples

Blocking spam transactions
==========================

A company is using the public chain to certify the quality of their products.

When the quality verification process concludes, an operator sends a :doc:`quality seal<mosaic>` to the product account.

The final customers can review the product mosaics scanning a QR code. For that reason, the company only wants to show related transactions, avoiding others to spam their products with non-related information.

    Blocking spam transactions

The company opts to configure their product accounts filters, enabling only to receive transactions containing ``company.quality.seal`` mosaics.

Enhancing the account security
==============================

Lately, Alice is only using her main account to cosign aggregate transactions where a :doc:`multisig<multisig-account>` she is a cosignatory is involved.

As a temporary measure, Alice opts to disable announcing transfer transactions from her main account, double checking that any of the funds she owns will be transferred.
